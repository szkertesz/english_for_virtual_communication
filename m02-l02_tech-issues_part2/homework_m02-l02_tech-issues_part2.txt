1. Terribly sorry guys, I got cut off. Could you please say the last bit again?
2. Sorry team, I'm afraid I can't hear you. Is it possible that you are on mute?
3. I seem to be having some issues sharing my screen. Hang on a second, I'm looking into it right now. Maybe restarting the app will solve it.
4. Unfortunately, I have a slight tech problem with the presentation software -- I'm not shure how can I load the slides. Please bear with me, I'll sort it out in a second.
5. I'm sorry to interrupt you John, I'm affraid your screen is frozen. Maybe stopping my video could save some bandwidth, let me give it a try.
6. Excuse me, but I have difficulties hearing you Mary, there is some background noise at your end. May I ask you to use a headset instead of you notebook mic?
