If I've understood you correctly... (focus on the conpletion on the action)

I'm afraid there's some kind of misunderstanding...

***

** direct questions

What is the time?
Do you like coding?
Have see the Queen?

** indirect questions (polite questions)

Can you please tell me ... 
I'd like to know ... What the time is?
I'm wondering ... if / whether you like coding? / if you have seen the Queen?
Could you inform me ... if you are tired?

***

I didn't (quite) catch this
