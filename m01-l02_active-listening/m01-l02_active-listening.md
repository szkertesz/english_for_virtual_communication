- wow, that's an interesting thought to me

- what I'm curious about is ...

- Absolutely.

- Yes, that's right

- Mm-hmm.

- really?

- All right.

- That's an interesting thought to me.

- OK, that's really cool.

- My question though is, 


      ! check that one has understood it correctly / check understanding !

      ! don't hijack the conversation !

***

- Was it? / Realy? What was ...

- Interesting! So ...

- Sure, sure.

- Nice.

Make comments and use "I'm listening" words.

a) "I'm interested" -- shorter ones:

   Really? / Wow. / Yep. / Yes. / Right / Interesting!

b) "I can add to that ..." -- longer ones:

   So you know the company pretty well. / Yeah, I had a similar experience. I ...

c) Echoing ("Really?")

   Was it? / 5 years?

d) Follow up Qs --- "So, tell me more"

   Really? What was that like?

1/3) Do you think
you interrupt
another speaker
when you use
active listening
techniques?

Actually, when
you use active
listening
techniques, you
keep the
conversation going
as well as showing
your interest.

2/3) How long do
you think your
comments should
be if you are
commenting on
something the
other speaker said?

Not too long,
as the primary
purpose of your
comments is to
show you are
interested, not to
take the
conversation over.

3/3) How typical
is echoing for the
English-speaking
culture? For your
culture?

Echoing is a
common feature of
English-speaking
communication
and therefore
should be learnt
and used as well.

It was nice to talk to you. Catch you later.
Sorry, but I'll need to go

Let's wrap it up here!
Let's call it a day! / I think we can call it a day!

I'm not shure!
I'm not shure either!

  My last trip to Spain was a blast ðŸ˜Š Itâ€™s a #1 vacation destination, in my opinion.
