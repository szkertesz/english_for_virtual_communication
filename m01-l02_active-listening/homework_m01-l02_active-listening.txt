Homework

1.
- I’m planning to go to Rwanda for my next vacation.
- Are you? Have you ever been in Africa?

2.
- I’m currently doing an online language course.
- Really? How did you find the most suitable language school?

3.
- We’re not going to meet this tight deadline for task A.
- That's too bad. Do you have a strategy to tackle this situation?

4.
- This kind of weather makes me depressed.
- Yeah, I can hear you. Only good music can help me cope with this. Do you have a favourite band?

5.
- I haven’t had a vacation for two years already.
- For two years? You must be quite a busy person. What routine you follow in order to recharge?
