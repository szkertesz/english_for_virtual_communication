1.
Looks like we don’t have any more questions. So **we're going to call it a day**. Thanks everyone who joined the meeting.

2.
So we hope these features will be incredibly useful as you promote your app. So **to recap**, we launched five key improvements in this new interface. These are…

3.
A: I’ve got a few more questions to ask. Mark, **how are we doing for time?**
B: We’ve got a few minutes left.

4.
Guys, thank you so much for taking the time. I know that we have a few questions left, but **we're running out of time** so we'll answer those by email.

5. We wanted to make sure that Chrome Apps had this capability. So with that, **I'll pass it over to** Joe **to walk you through** the new Media Galleries API.

6. 
A: The last question is about quotas.
B: **Sorry guys, I need to run to another meeting**. Thanks everyone.

7. With that, I think **we're going to wrap up**. I’ll share the meeting recording and send a follow-up email a bit later today.

8. But I'm going to just talk about some stuff you need to be careful of. And then **I'll turn it over to** Paul **to run you through** DevTools.

1. I'll answer briefly and then pass it over to Ryan.
2. So going back to where we were, let’s agree that these timings seem unreasonable.
3. So to recap, these are the five main points of the attendance policy.
4. And I'm going to run you through the architecture of the device.
5. We’re just about out of time, but let’s proceed to the questions anyway.
6. I'm inviting our project manager Jake to start us off with the meeting agenda.
7. I suppose we're getting a little off topic here.
8. Sorry, I have to run to another meeting, but we'll talk soon. Bye everyone.
9. Before I get to this slide, I just wanted to take you through the intermediate results.
10. I'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just integration.
11. I would just add some critical observations and then turn it over to Kevin.
12. We’re going to call it a day at this stage and head back to the office.

We're going to start with question 1 and I'll **pass it over / turn it over** to Alex to run you through the changes quickly. (=It's Alex's turn now to speak on the topic)

Jane, maybe you could **start us** off with an overview of the app. (=Jane, please tell us about …)

Madina, perhaps you could **take us through** the changes. (=Madina, please tell us about …)

I suppose that’s a little **off topic**. (=It’s irrelevant)

So **going back to** where we were, there’s a lot we have to do this week. (=What was I saying?)

Sorry guys, I need to **run to another** meeting. (=Sorry, I have to leave)

We’re just **about out** of time. (=The time’s almost up)

How are we **doing for** time? (=Is the time up?)

So **to recap**, we've come a long way in implementing the changes. (=to summarize)

We're going **to call it** a day. (=Let's stop working)
