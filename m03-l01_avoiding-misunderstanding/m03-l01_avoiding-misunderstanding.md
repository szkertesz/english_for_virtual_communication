I might be breaking up because of my connection's not stable.

Come again! (can you say that again?)
***

Can you bring more details on the table?

Enjoy the rest of the wednesday!

***
1. 
A: **What do you mean by** completely secure?

B: **What I mean is** users need to be completely firewalled from each other.

2. 
**Sorry, I didn't hear the last part / bit.** Could you repeat that, please?

3. 
A: **So basically what you're saying is** I, as a webmaster, have to manage the comments in the comment section. **Is that accurate?**

B: **Yes, pretty much. / Yes, that's correct.** Otherwise, your users might be annoyed by all those spammy comments.

4. 

A: I’m not sure I get it. **Can you elaborate / expand on that?**

A: Hello? Can you hear me?

B: I seem to be having some tech issues. **I'm afraid I didn't catch the question.** Could you say it again?

5. 
A: **If I understand you correctly**, each team member is gonna be assigned a different role in the next sprint. **Is that right?**

B: **No, not really**. We just want to pair you up a bit differently, but overall the tasks will remain the same.

6. 
I don’t think I got it right. **Can you be a bit more specific about what you mean by that?**

7. 
**I’m not quite shure what you mean by that.** (=I don’t know if I understand you correctly)

***

1. So **what do you mean by** social design patterns, and how does that work?

2. I'm sorry. You said, some libraries …  **I didn't catch** which libraries. Some?

3. They do this using the Border Gateway Protocol, which lets each user set the rules for when traffic can access their network. **Does that make sense?**

4. **Can you be a little bit more specific about what you mean by** budget limitations? (=Can you clarify what you mean by ...)

5. 
    A: So let me understand your question. So **basically what you're saying is** you want to manage these scripts using Drive SDK. Now, **I think what you're talking about is** the Drive API, the Docs List API, right?

    B: Yeah.

6. 
    A: All that's removed from you in this game is your money, **is that what you're saying?**

    B: Yeah, **pretty much**. I'm a super big fan of this game. I think it's fantastic.

    B: No, not really. **What I mean is** ... (=I just want to say that …)

7. I mean, **if I understand your question correctly**, **what you're saying is** they're afraid that if they give they'll get to that place again where they have nothing?

8. **Could you elaborate on that** 'cause that doesn't quite answer my question?

9. 
    B: OK, **can I expand on** that question slightly? / **Let me expand / alaborate on that.** (=Let me add more details)

    A: Yeah, absolutely.

    B: What we'd like is, we have this great…

## Extra mile

https://englishwithkim.com/clarifying-confirming-understanding/

use an itroductory phrase:

- Would you mind ... ?
- Could I ask you ... ?

start with a small apology:

- Sorry ...
- Just a second ...
- Sorry to interrupt ...

admit you missed something:

- I didn't catch that
- I didn't get that
- I want be sure I understood
- I want to make sure I heard that right

- Would you mind going over that one more time?
- Sorry, could I ask you to tell me that (piece of information) again?
- Could you clarify what you meant by (challenging word)?
- Just a second, could I get a little more clarification on (X topic)? I just want to be sure I understood.
- Sorry to interrupt, but I didn’t catch that. Could you run it by me one more time?
- Could you be more specific?
- I don’t think I got your meaning. Could you go over that again?
- I don’t think I quite understand what you meant. Would you mind repeating that?

### Confirm Your Understanding By Repeating and Restating the Other Person’s Idea

- Let me see if I understood correctly.
- Can I just check what I got from that?
- **I’d just like to confirm that I got that right.**
- **My impression of what you said was…  Is that what you meant?**
- So what you are saying is… Does that sound right?
- You mean that we should (do X action and Y action). Is that right?
- Do I understand you to mean…
- If I understand you correctly, you are saying…
- **Am I reading your suggestion right, when you said…?**
- You mean…?
- I think you are saying…
- In other words…

### Say Thank You and Show You Understood
