# Softening

sounding polite,
tactful, and diplomatic by using different softening
techniques

*tactful* - careful not to say or do anything that will annoy or upset other people <-> *tactless*

***
Does it seem good enough?

We don't seem to have enough time to finish.

It seemes to me ...

It's too late -> It's a bit too late. / It's slightly too late.

I don't think it's such a good idea.

The requirements seem a bit / slightly unclear.

You seem to have some problem with the meetings. Can I assist in any way?

We'll most likely miss the deadline.
***

1. Add a softening word / phrase

- *"a little"*
  - This is **a bit** problematic.
  - The dots are **slightly too** / **a bit too** / **a little too** big.

- *"I'm sorry, but ..."*
  - **I'm affraid**, it's not the best solution.
  - **Unfortunately** the export function doesn't seem to work properly.

- *"It looks like ..."*
  - Setting up a onepager **seems** a better option.
    - The action bar **seems (to be)** slightly oversized. (before adjective)
    - The update **seems** *to have* some bugs. (before noun)
    - Jack **seems (to be)** a better *candidate*. (before to-infinitive)
  - Unfortunately, the export function **doesn't seem to** work properly.

    (in negative sentences: **don't / doesn't** *before* "seem")

2. Use a modal verb

- *"It's possible that ... / Isn't it possible that ... ?"*
  - This **might / could** be problematic.
  - This **would** be quite difficult to implement at this point.
  - **Wouldn't** that be a bit too difficult?/

3. replace negative words with positive ones
   - *"this isn't good"*
     - This plan is a bad option. => This plan would**n't** be the **best** option.
     - I think we'll fail. => I **don't** think we'll **succeed**.

***

1. The situation is **a bit strange**.

2. **There seems to be** something wrong with the drop-down menu.

3. **Unfortunately,** the colors of the headings and the buttons **don't seem to match well together**.
