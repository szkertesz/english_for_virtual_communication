# USING LINKING WORDS TO SHOW CONTRAST

https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/linking-words-contrast.html

## Although

We can use 'although' at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence. It is used in front of a clause (a clause has at least a subject and a verb that agrees with the subject).

- **Although** the weather is bad, I love London.
- I love London, **although** the weather is bad.

## Despite / in spite of

We use 'despite' or 'in spite of' before a noun or a gerund. It can also go in the middle or at the beginning of a sentence. 'Despite' and 'in spite of' mean exactly the same thing. You can choose whichever one you like! If you want to use 'despite' or 'in spite of' before a clause, you need to add 'the fact that'.

- I love London **despite** the bad weather.
- I love London **in spite of** the bad weather.
***
- **Despite** the bad weather, I love London.
- **In spite of** the bad weather, I love London.
***
- **Despite the fact that** the weather is bad, I love London.
- **In spite of the fact that** the weather is bad, I love London.
***
- I love London **despite the fact that** the weather is bad.
- I love London **in spite of the fact that** the weather is bad.

## However

We use 'although' and 'despite / in spite of' to connect two clauses in the same sentence. On the other hand, 'however' isn't used to connect two clauses. Instead, we usually put the two ideas in two separate sentences. We put 'however' in the second sentence, and we can put it at the beginning, at the end, or after the subject.

- I love London. **However**, the weather is bad.
- I love London. The weather, **however**, is bad.
- I love London. The weather is bad, **however**.
